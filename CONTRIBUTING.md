#Contributing

##Code style
- I use [Airbnb's code style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for this project - not all project code conforms yet
- I'm using [eslint](http://eslint.org/) to lint my JavaScript

##Fixing code
If you find something you want to fix, please open an issue for each issue and refer to them in your commits, it helps keep track of what the issue is and allows others to give advice

##Tests
:cold_sweat: [working on it](https://github.com/robcalcroft/mondoweb/issues/3) 

---
I'm very open to suggestions on best practices for the repo.
