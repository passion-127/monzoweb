#Contributing

##Code style
- I use [Airbnb's code style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for this project - not all project code conforms yet
- I'm using [eslint](http://eslint.org/) to lint my JavaScript

##Fixing or adding something
If you find something you want to fix, please open an issue for each issue and refer to them in your commits, it helps keep track of what the issue is and allows others to give advice

##Commits
When you make a commit, please ensure you have opened an issue about it (see above), and then follow this format:
```
(#<issue number>) - <below 50 characters of description, using present tense>
```
For example
```
(#3) - Fix broken links on accounts page
```

##Tests
:cold_sweat: [working on it](https://github.com/robcalcroft/mondoweb/issues/3)

I'm very open to suggestions on best practices for the repo.
